# Project 2 - Stats 607

Submission repository for Project 2 - *Simulation study* of the course Stats 607 - *Programming and Numerical method in Statistics*.

The repository implements the experiment in the paper *Controlling the False Discovery Rate: a Practical and Powerful
Approach to Multiple Testing*, published in JRSSB 1995 by Benjamini and Hochberg (that introduces BH correction). The parameters are saved and can be adjusted in the file `params.json`. Use `make test` to run the test suite, and `make all` to run the experiment.
